# pokedex

This project was intended as a gift to my little sisters who really love Pokemon.

## Getting Started

This project is one of my fisrt project with flutter. I use the PokeAPI to create this comprehensive dictionary about the world of Pokemon.

## UI

- Light mode
  <p float="left">
    <img src="assets/demos/home_light.png" width="150" />
    <img src="assets/demos/detail_light.png" width="150" /> 
    <img src="assets/demos/drawer_light.png" width="150" /> 
    <img src="assets/demos/search_light.png" width="150" /> 
  </p>
- Dark mode
  <p float="left">
    <img src="assets/demos/home_dark.png" width="150" />
    <img src="assets/demos/detail_dark.png" width="150" /> 
    <img src="assets/demos/drawer_dark.png" width="150" /> 
    <img src="assets/demos/search_dark.png" width="150" /> 
  </p>

## Features

- Comprehensive information about every pokemon
- Pokemons can be organised by many categories like color, habitat, shape,...
- Users can save their favorite pokemons by tapping the star button in the action bar (tap again to remove)
- Various setting can be accessed by the user to custom the app as the user like it to be (more setting coming in the future)
